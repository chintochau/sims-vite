1. memory stream: a long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a
comprehensive list of the agent’s experiences. A memory retrieval
model combines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the
records needed to inform the agent’s moment-to-moment behavior
2. reflection: which synthesizes memories into higherlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions
about itself and others to better guide its behavior
3. planning: translates those conclusions and the current environment into high-level action plans and then recursively into
detailed behaviors for action and reaction
4. These reflections and plans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent’s future behavior
